                            Thanks to the gold medal he won on 25 July, 2021, Horigome became a name overnight, shooting to national stardom. The sponsors lined up. Everyone wanted a piece of him. If there was one skateboarder Joe Blow in Japan could name, it was Horigome.

                            But it became a burden. Handcuffed by the commercial commitments and public expectations, the carefree spirit from downtown Tokyo, at one point, even thought about packing it in. To him, it wasn’t a lot of fun. It wasn’t why he got into skateboarding to begin with.
                            
                            Yet Horigome stuck it out. He found balance. Balance between what he wanted to do - to proliferate skateboarding and embed its culture in Japan - and what he had to do. Then came peace.
                            
                            Horigome won’t lie. He still doesn’t particularly care for all the baggage that comes with being an Olympic champion and a world-famous skateboarder, hounded by people wherever he goes.
                            
                            But he gets it. He understands what an Olympic gold medal brought him - and what it can continue to bring him, should he reach Paris. It’s why he’s all in for OQS.
                            
                            “Of course there is an aspect to contests that makes me happy,” Horigome said. “But there is the preparation for it. You need to be in a certain frame of mind. You have to maintain your body. It really has not been rosy for the most part.
                            
                            “But when you have that good ride that lead to results, it finally gives you joy. Friends. Family. When you make the people who support you happy, there is a sensation you feel for a split second.
                            
                            “Sure, I do this for myself but I do it just as much to have that feeling. It’s why I compete. Plus entering contests does give you new opportunities.
                            
                            “And the Olympics was the place that gave me such opportunities. I want to keep taking strides and chase new dreams or whatever it is that I want to do.”
